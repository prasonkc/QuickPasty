You're sad.
Maybe the person you crushed on didn't reply to you. 
Maybe you failed your first job interview.. And then the second. And then the third. 
Maybe you broke up with someone you really loved. 
Maybe someone close to you passed away. 
Maybe you just failed some really important exams. 
Maybe you didn't secure a fund for your startup. 
Or maybe your business which one you poured your heart and soul into — fell apart.

You want to cry, but you can't. 
You don't feel like doing anything. 
You're not motivated to get out of bed. 
You might even be depressed. 
You might be questioning your life. 
Your purpose. 
Maybe you even want to end everything.

Each and every single person experienced today differently. 
Some might be overjoyed, but you? 
You are barely holding on.

But...

Let me ask you this:

"Does it matter?"

The world doesn't stop moving because you're sad.
It won’t pause because you cease to exist.
Your pain feels infinite, but it is so insignificant. Microscopic. 
You're smaller than a bacterium in the realm of gods.

You’re in a city, a few kilometers wide, inside a country of a few hundred thousand square kilometers,
on a planet just a few hundred million square kilometers wide,
in a solar system spanning trillions,
inside a galaxy hundreds of thousands of trillions wide,
among trillions of other galaxies — each with hundreds of times more stars, thousands of times more planets, and maybe… gazillions of universes beyond that.
 
There are 8 billion people on this planet.
Maybe 8 billion more on another.
Maybe 4 billion on a smaller one.
Maybe 100 billion on some distant, larger world.
And perhaps a few trillion more circling black holes.
and we don't even have numbers to count them all. 

And here you are — sad because one person didn’t text back.
Because one company didn’t accept you.
Because you failed one exam in this vast madness of the multiverse.

You are so insignificant. 
But so am I. 
So is your crush who didn't text you back. 
So is the company that rejected you.
So is your ex who hurt you.
So are your exams. 
So are your parents when they yell at you. 
So are your friends when they ignore you.

What happens after you’re gone?
A few people cry.
A few might laugh.
They mourn for a few days.
But your friends won't quit their job. 
Your ex won't stay single forever. 
Your parents won't remember you as often. 
People you love, they might forget your favorite food,
your favorite color, 
your favorite games, 
your favorite music, 
your favorite movies. 
They might forget the shape of your face. 
The color of your eyes. 
The sound of your voice. 
The warmth of your smile. 
You will become a distant memory to them. 
And within a hundred years, if you’re just a normal person, no one will remember you at all.
Even the traces of your name will be erased by time.

It's hard to digest, but it's the truth. 
People move on. So should you. 
The business that you left behind, they will hire a new CEO. 
The job that you once dreamed of, they will hire a new employee. 
The girl that rejected you, she will get married to someone else. 

You're just a nobody. 
The universe doesn’t care about you — and it’s pointless to make it care.

Then, what should you do?

Maybe, just maybe - care for yourself?

Tonight, go out on your balcony.
Or find a quiet park.
Put on your favorite music.
Look up at the sky.
Is the moon beautiful? 
Are there clouds? 
What shape do they make?
Can you see the stars? 
How many?

Try counting them.
You lose track at ten?
Try again? fifty?
Try again? five hundred?

Okay. 
Stop counting. 
Lay down. 
Observe. 

Each of those stars is a hundred times bigger than our sun.
Each has its own system, with more than eight planets.
So take your number — and multiply it by eight.
How many Earths does that make?
How many humans could live there?

Too many to count, right?
And yet, that's only what your eyes can see.

Maybe your nerdy friend with glasses and a telescope could see twice as many.
Maybe they’d see a cow where you see a horse.
Maybe another friend would call it a unicorn.
And while you argue about who’s right,
remember this — there are gazillions more stars that none of you can even see.

So, Let me ask you this one more time:

"Does it really matter?"
